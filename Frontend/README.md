# Front Technical Assessment

The aim of this assessment is to give us an insight into your thought processes, general approach & problem solving skills.
It also gives us an understanding of your knowledge on the four primary front-end pillars:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js

## The Assessment

- To be completed on CodeSanbox (https://codesandbox.io/).
- You will create a list of five collapsible items, each item will consist of the following components:
  - A title containing a toggle
  - A content block containing at least two paragraphs of text

## The Rules

- You must use React.JS framework.
- You may use any other libraries and preprocessors you would like, this is entirely up to you.
- It should be possible for more than one collapsible list to co-exist on the same page without affecting another.
- The first item in the list should be expanded by default, all other items should be collapsed.
- Toggles must collapse/expand the associated content block on click, no other content block should be affected.
- Hover & active states should be visually obvious.
- The first item in the list should have rounded top corners.
- The last item in the list should have rounded bottom corners, except when it's opened/active.
- Animated collapse/expand transitions are optional if time permits.
- It should have Unit Tests. For this you can use any testing framework you would like.
